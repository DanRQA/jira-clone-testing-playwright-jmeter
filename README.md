### Jira frontend clone

A simplified Jira clone application with some custom modifications. It only includes the frontend -the backend is simulated with fake API calls and mock data. This is a personal project for practicing skills and it is not intended to work as a real Jira application. 

I have take inspiration from the actual [Jira website](https://www.atlassian.com/es/software/jira), as well as from [Trello](https://trello.com/). For pragmatic purposes, many features are not included. Others have been modified according to my tastes. The application should serve the basic functionalities of a project management software.
